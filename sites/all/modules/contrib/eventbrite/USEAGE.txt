Useage for the Eventbrite Drupal module and Eventbrite field.
======

This documentation only deals with the Eventbrite and Eventbrite field modules.
The OG and Subuser modules are not covered here.

First, be sure both the Eventbrite and Eventbrite field modules are enabled.

You should also make sure the Eventbrite.php library is installed.

And thirdly, we assume that you already have an Eventbrite account, that you've
applied for an API key and gotten it, and that you have an event set up on
Eventbrite.com.

Go to the page for your event on Eventbrite.com. It might have a URL like this:
https://www.eventbrite.com/myevent?eid=12263463349

The 'eid' parameter is the ID of your event. Make note of it.

Eventbrite API
==============

Let's set up Drupal to use our API key, and thus connect it to our account.

If you haven't yet, apply for an Eventbrite API key. Once you have one, you can
get to it at this URL: https://www.eventbrite.com/myaccount/apps/

You'll also need your Eventbrite API User Key. This is different from your
regular user name. You can get it at this URL:
https://www.eventbrite.com/userkeyapi

Now visit your web site's Eventbrite configuration page at this path:
admin/config/services/eventbrite

Here you'll see the API settings tab. This is where you enter your API key and
user key. Remember to click 'Save Configuration.'

Eventbrite Field
================

Now we'll add the Eventbrite field to a content type. We'll just use the Article
content type for now.

We'll manage the Article fields here:
admin/structure/types/manage/article/fields

At the bottom, add a new field. We'll label it 'Eventbrite Field,' because we're not
very creative.

Set the field type to 'Eventbrite', and the widget to 'Autocomplete Event ID'.

Click 'Save,' and we'll just use the defaults for all of the field settings for
now.

How click the 'Manage Display' tab, or just go to this path:
admin/structure/types/manage/article/display

Change the 'Format' of the Eventbrite field to 'Eventbrite iFrame.' Click 'Save.'

Congratulations. You've attached an Eventbrite field to a content type.

Enter Some Data
===============

Add an Article. You could use a path like this: node/add/article

Be sure and enter required fields, like the title.

If you scroll down the Article form, you'll see your Eventbrite Field.

Enter the eid (event ID) parameter you noted above.

Check out that Drupal will attempt to autocomplete the event ID number as you
type it.

Now click 'Save.'

You will see your new article content, with a nice iframe display of the
Eventbrite event.
