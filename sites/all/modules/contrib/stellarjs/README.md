- Adds a Views display mode (flexslider_views)

About Stellarjs
----------------

Library available at https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js

**Parallax has never been easier.**
Add some simple data attributes to your markup, run $.stellar().
That's all you need to get started. Scroll right to see Stellar.js in action.

**Precisely align elements and backgrounds.**
All elements and backgrounds will return to their original position when they meet the edge of the screenâ€”plus or minus your own optional offset.
